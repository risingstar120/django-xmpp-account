Dear {{ user }}!

You have registered this {{ domain }} Jabber account with your client. If you
ever loose your password, the only way to reset your password is via this site:

    https://account.jabber.at

The site requires an email confirmation and you haven't yet given us an email
address. You can do so here: 

    https://account.jabber.at/reset/email/

You can continue to use your account just fine without giving us an email
address at all. You will just not be able to reset your password if you ever
loose it. The email address is never used in daily operations and will of
course never be given to anyone.

Please also see our homepage for more information:

greetings, 
your {{ domain }} team
